# What it is
Homework from the course "Otus PHP Pro", on the topic: "Linux/Bash"

## Task source
Otus PHP Pro course: https://fas.st/wRyRs

## Target:
Learn to write bash scripts for everyday tasks

## Description/Step activity homework:
Write a console application (bash script),
which takes two numbers and outputs their number to stdout.

for example
```
./sum.sh 1.5 -7
```

If invalid arguments are provided
(to check for detection of passages that can be observed)

If you are running scripts based on ``Docker under Windows 10``,
then the behavior of the sort function by default is different from the standard one in linux
(numbers are sorted as numbers, not as strings)

There is a table like this:
```
id  user      landline    id
1   test      Moscow      1234123
2   test2     Saint-P     1232121
3   test3     Tver        4352124
4   test4     Milan       7990923
5   test5     Moscow      908213
```
Discovery table in a text file.

Display the 3 most popular cities among system users,
using Linux.
Hint: It is recommended to use the ``uniq, awk, sort, head`` utilities.

## Criteria for evaluation:
Numbers to sum
The bc package for Linux distributions is not the default package.

Or consider the moment when the package is not installed,
or solve the problem by other means.
